# Computational Methods & C++
The application of numerical schemes for the solution of partial differential equations using C++ Object Oriented language.

The first order wave equation : [see here](http://farside.ph.utexas.edu/teaching/329/lectures/node90.html) for an example of the advection equation we're trying to solve.
## What does the program do ?
This C++ program solves the above problem on a uniform grid with the prescribed initial and boundary conditions using the following methods: 
  * Explicit Upwind FTBS (Forward time, Backward space) 
  * Implicit Upwind FTBS (Forward time, Backward space) 
  * Lax-Wendroff 
  * Implicit FTCS (Forward time, Central space)
